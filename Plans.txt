            (!file exists)
                Display error describing 
                there is no data associated with the hostname
                Give directions/link for registering hostname

Useablilty:
    Display all of the images which can be displayed
        Have button on each one; 'Use this image'.
    Have a page which displays the 'status' of each machine.
        Shows all info associated with each ad the player serves
        Shows if wayfinding is enabled for this machine.
        Idea: This status page would be where ads are added / removed
            Very user friendly!
    Display a drop down of every registered machine
        Determines which machine the ads will be displayed on.
