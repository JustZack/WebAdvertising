Displaying accross multiple machines with different ads:
    Multiple AdContent-info files depending on machine.
        PHP needs hostname, and then decides which file to use.
        {
            Request to load page
            PHP retreives hostname of requester
            PHP determines which file to read from
            (file exists)
                Serve page
            (!file exists)
                Display error describing 
                there is no data associated with the hostname
                Give directions/link for registering hostname
        }

Useablilty:
    Display all of the images which can be displayed
        Have button on each one; 'Use this image'.
    Have a page which displays the 'status' of each machine.
        Shows all info associated with each ad the player serves
        Shows if wayfinding is enabled for this machine.
        Idea: This status page would be where ads are added / removed
            Very user friendly!
    Display a drop down of every registered machine
        Determines which machine the ads will be displayed on.
        Consider having groups
            Ex: South facing 1 & 2
                RamTech
                1st Floor Hallway


What is left to do:
    * = Not super important (to me)

    *Allow editing of Ads in a group

    *Users click the content on the server they want and the box is auto populated with the path.
    
    Add possibility for a load-delay
        >If specified, ad src/href will be refreshed that amount of time before the ad plays
        >Which ensures ads coming from the LSC's site will be loaded at the right time

    Do I need to rework how ads are cycled through?
        >Be able to acomdate for "specific-time" ads.
            >Currently: 
                Ad is added to DOM if it is set to occur within the next 15 minutes
                Timeout is set for playing the ad (this may not work)
