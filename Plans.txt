Displaying accross multiple machines with different ads:
    Multiple AdContent-info files depending on machine.
        PHP needs hostname, and then decides which file to use.
        {
            Request to load page
            PHP retreives hostname of requester
            PHP determines which file to read from
            (file exists)
                Serve page
            (!file exists)
                Display error describing 
                there is no data associated with the hostname
                Give directions/link for registering hostname
        }

Useablilty:
    Display all of the images which can be displayed
        Have button on each one; 'Use this image'.
    Have a page which displays the 'status' of each machine.
        Shows all info associated with each ad the player serves
        Shows if wayfinding is enabled for this machine.
        Idea: This status page would be where ads are added / removed
            Very user friendly!
    Display a drop down of every registered machine
        Determines which machine the ads will be displayed on.
        Consider having groups
            Ex: South facing 1 & 2
                RamTech
                1st Floor Hallway
What is left to do:
    wayfinding <- really should start taking priority
    Uploading local content to the server
    Ability to choose a file already on the server when uploading content.
    Ability to Add nickname to a player
    Ability to rename a group or player
        This could be complicated, gonna wait till just about everything else is done!
